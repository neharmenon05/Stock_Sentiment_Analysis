# Abstract:
The aim of this project is to develop an NLP model to analyze and predict the stock market using sentimental analysis. The methodology involves preprocessing text data, generating numerical features through n-grams, and training two machine learning models, Logistic Regression as a baseline and Random Forest for complex pattern recognition. Comparison of the two models is done to find the most accurate model. The model will be trained with historical data of previous stock market values to determine the effectiveness in predicating stock trends. This model predicts the stock market by searching for the market words which could influence the next day's stock market.
